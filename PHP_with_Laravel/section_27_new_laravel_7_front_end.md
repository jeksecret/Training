# Insights on this Section
- In this section it is only a short tutorial, what I did is setting up the scaffolding Login & Registration page for bootstrap by installing the package ```composer require laravel/ui``` and ```php artisan ui bootstrap --auth``` same as I did in section 22. And added a dashboard template for admin into the laravel project.
