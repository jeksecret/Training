`Roles`
- are collections of permissions that can be assigned to a user or a group of users.

- For example, a user with the "admin" role may have permissions to perform all actions within an application, while a user with the "guest" role may only have permission to view certain parts of the application.
- By using permissions and roles, you can ensure that your application is secure and that users only have access to the parts of the application that they are authorized to use.
